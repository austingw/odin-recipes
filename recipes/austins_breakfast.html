    <h1>Austin's Famous Breakfast</h1>
    <img src="austinbreakky.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my real, genuine daily breakfast. I eat this at least 5x a week unless I am fasting. Similar to David Lynch, I find consistency in my diet really does free the mind. I'd like to eventually just have 7 copies of the same outfit as well, a la Einstein.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large free range eggs</li>
        <li>3 turkey sausage links</li>
        <li>1 cup of greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 apple (pink lady or granny smith recommended)</li>
        <li>1 cup of coffee or can of monster</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place medium saucepan on stove</li>
        <li>Add either olive oil or cooking spray to pan and bring to medium heat</li>
        <li>Add eggs and turkey saugsage to pan</li>
        <li>Cook until eggs are overhard and sausage is brown on both sides</li>
        <li>Place cooked eggs on plate</li>
